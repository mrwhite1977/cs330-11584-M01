1. How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-What design process did you follow for your project work?
-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

**This project has helped me to build several skills using OpenGL. I have learned how to create 3D primitives, how to change the size and scale of those primitives, and how to place each object in a scene in relation to one another. I also learned how to apply textures and material effects to objects to acheive more natural representations. And I learned how to apply lighting to a scene to create realistic effects. I approached this project modularly. I began my identifying what primitives I needed to recreate my scene objects. I then worked to create each object and added new effects and features as described above. This methodical approach is beneficial as it allows you to plan out your work and focus on one aspect at a time.**

3. How do I approach developing programs?
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
-How did iteration factor into your development?
-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

**For me, iteration was the most important strategies on this project. After reading the material and examining some example code, I would begin with one primitive like a cube. Once coded, I would render the cube, examine how it met my needs, and then went back to the code to make adjustments. I did this with every aspect of the project. I would tinker with the object whether simple or complex until I was satisfied. I did have examples of going back to change one object because of changes to another. Due to the constant interating, making these changes were not too difficult. Each milestone built upon what came before. Iteration has been discussed throughout this degree program.**

5. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

**The best concept I learned in this course is the power of interation. Other courses have broken down work in piece. However, I really got to see how iteration works in this class. Perhaps because there was a visually representation of the work. Taking time to plan out your work flow and create a roadmap will help manage my time and make me more productive. Plans may change and expectations may be revised, but with a plan in place, teams can make adjustments more quickly.**
